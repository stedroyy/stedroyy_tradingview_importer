to use the importer 

1. pipinstall the required libraries
2. (optional) change the name of the csv export (this can be done after the csv has been created anyways so its not a big deal)
3. run the file, then copy from your tradingview csv and pate it into the prompt (seperated by line, but tradingview export does that automatically, so just ctrl +a, ctrl +c, ctrl +v should work fine
